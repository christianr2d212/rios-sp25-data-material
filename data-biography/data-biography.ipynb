    "From 1924-1926, the Denver Chapter of the KKK collected 29600 entries of it's member applications in two ledgers. A worker from the Rocky Mountain News then donated these ledgers to the State Historical Society (now [History Colorado](https://coloradoencyclopedia.org/article/history-colorado-colorado-historical-society)). Around 1990, History Colorado accessioned the KKK ledgers into their research center so researchers could look at the books. History Colorado then [digitzed the ledgers](https://www.historycolorado.org/kkkledgers)in the 2000s as a way to make the data more accessible to the public. The two ledgers were made into pdf files that are accesible through hyperlinks on the History Colorado (HC) website and in the dataset itself.\n",

This is the dataset I am using to make the pandas dataframe."

    "Bringing up the Stapleton name is an example of important political and cultural context to keep in mind about this data. Namely, about the prevalance of KKK members in Colorado's 1920 politics. The KKK frequently had periods of decline and resurgence, and the 1920s is one of them. Colorado at one point had the [second highest](https://youtu.be/PO5PMbtF1t8?si=2J_gIOA9oI9aGaeM) per-capita KKK membership in United States. The surge in KKK membership came from increased xenophobia after increased immigration of Italians, Jewish people, and Mexicans to the U.S in the early 1900s. According to RMPBS [*Colorado Experience*](https://youtu.be/PO5PMbtF1t8?si=2J_gIOA9oI9aGaeM), lynchings of people of color in Colorado were common during the 1920s, including but not limited to Black, Mexican, and Italian people."

    "There are about 34 columns within the dataset. Many of the columns are extra columns for string data like business or residence addresses. Ledger links and references to what page of the ledger take up 5 columns. There are 3 columns with boolean values. The first simply seems to tell whether or not a symbol was written next to someone's name in the ledger. The last two, 'sNumber and sErased' are a bit unclear. In the physical ledgers some members have an 's' written next to their membership number. If the s is faded or erased then the index lists both the columns as true. There is no clear reason for why this is noted."

Without the inclusion of this column, the kkk-dataset would look more like \"raw\" data than actual \"cooked\" data because it would not show that this ledger was physically annotated by the original authors. \n",

For example, some locations are linked to Auraria and Empower Field as both were previously neighborhoods. The area around the Bronco's Stadium in particular was a thriving Jewish neighborhood in early 20th Century. What might be missing for this data is a map of 1920s Denver that can line up with the data."
